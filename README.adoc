= Service Checker

Checks if services still work.

    service-checker <scriptfolder> <outfolder>


== Interface

Folder `<scriptfolder>`, that contains scripts that are executable.

Each script is called by the checker and returns:

* 0 - if the services it checks works
* 1 - in any other case

Each script outputs one or more lines of information (about the returncode) to `stdout`.
Script errors are returned on `stderr`.


== Output

All script outputs are saved in `<outfolder>`.

The directory structure is the following:

    /<scriptname>/
        status
        information

`status` contains the return value of the script.
`information` contains the information the script printed to `stdout`.


= Statuspage

Outputs a html statuspage and a JSON status info from the service-checker output to pagedirectory.

    statuspage <outfolder> <pagedirectory>
